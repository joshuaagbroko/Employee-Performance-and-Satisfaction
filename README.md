# 📊 Employee Performance & Satisfaction Dashboard
Welcome to my Project focused on employee performance evaluation and Human Resources analytics. This end-to-end project demonstrates how to extract actionable insights from HR datasets by leveraging Google BigQuery for data cleaning and Google Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) for dynamic data visualization.

## 🚀 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze employee performance metrics and HR data to identify key factors affecting productivity, engagement, and retention. This case study mimics a real-world business scenario where HR departments seek to improve decision-making using data-driven insights.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of 5 CSV files containing information on:

- Employee records

- Appraisal levels

- Satisfaction Rating

- Performance Rating

- Education Level

These files are ingested, merged, and preprocessed in Google BigQuery for efficient querying and analysis.
