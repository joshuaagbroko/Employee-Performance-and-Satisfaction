# 📊 Employee Performance & Satisfaction Dashboard
Welcome to my Project focused on employee performance evaluation and Human Resources analytics. This end-to-end project demonstrates how to extract actionable insights from HR datasets by leveraging Google BigQuery for data cleaning and Google Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) for dynamic data visualization.

## 🚀 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze employee performance metrics and HR data to identify key factors affecting productivity, engagement, and retention. This case study mimics a real-world business scenario where HR departments seek to improve decision-making using data-driven insights.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of 5 CSV files containing information on:

- Employee records

- Appraisal levels

- Satisfaction Rating

- Performance Rating

- Education Level

These files are ingested, merged, and preprocessed in Google BigQuery for efficient querying and analysis.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Demonstrated

✅ Summary of key findings and recommendations
The employee performance and satisfaction analysis highlights that attrition is most prevalent among younger employees aged 18–25, particularly within the Technology department. Key factors driving turnover include low Work-Life Balance ratings, longer tenure without promotion, and declining satisfaction with management over time. Salary distribution shows that while higher education levels correlate with higher pay, attrition rates remain significant across all education backgrounds. Employees who report strong satisfaction with their managers and career progression opportunities tend to demonstrate greater loyalty and longer tenure, emphasizing the critical role of leadership and professional development in retention.

Based on these insights, the recommended actions focus on enhancing Work-Life Balance through flexible work policies and wellness initiatives, implementing career development programs targeted at younger employees, and investing in continuous managerial training to strengthen leadership effectiveness. Regular compensation reviews, especially within the Technology department, and proactive job satisfaction assessments tied to clear organizational actions are essential strategies to reduce turnover and foster a more engaged and stable workforce.
